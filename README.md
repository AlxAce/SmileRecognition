A simple neural network for recognizing positive and negative smileys.

How it works?

Before recognizing smilies, we need to train the neural network.
Step 1. Draw positive emoticon. Press the V key on your keyboard and in the pop-up window, click OK. Repeat several times (the more the better the network will recognize)
And press key C that clear canvas.

Step 2. Draw negative emoticon.  Press the V key on your keyboard and in the pop-up window, click Cancel. Repeat several times (the more the better the network will recognize)
And press key C that clear canvas.

Step 3. Draw positive or negative emoticon and press key B on keyboard. In popup you'll see result of recognition. If the  recogniz is bad repeat steps 1 and 2.
